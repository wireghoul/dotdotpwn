### DESCRIPTION ###

DotDotPwn - The Directory Traversal Fuzzer

It's a very flexible intelligent fuzzer to discover traversal
directory vulnerabilities in software such as HTTP/FTP/TFTP
servers, Web platforms such as CMSs, ERPs, Blogs, etc.

Also, it has a protocol-independent module to send the desired
payload to the host and port specified. On the other hand, it
also could be used in a scripting way using the STDOUT module.

It's written in perl programming language and can be run
either under OS X, *NIX or Windows platforms. It's the first Mexican
tool included in BackTrack Linux (BT4 R2).

Fuzzing modules supported in this version:
- HTTP
- HTTP URL
- FTP
- TFTP
- Payload (Protocol independent)
- STDOUT


### REQUIREMENTS ###

- Perl (http://www.perl.org)
Programmed and tested on Perl 5.8.8 and 5.10

- Nmap (http://www.nmap.org)
Only if you plan to use the OS detection feature
(needs root privileges)

Perl modules:
- Net::FTP
- TFTP (only required if fuzzing TFTP)
- Time::HiRes
- Socket
- IO::Socket
- Getopt::Std

You can easily install the missing modules doing the
following as root:

```
# perl -MCPAN -e "install <MODULE_NAME>"
```

or

```
# cpan
cpan> install <MODULE_NAME>
```
